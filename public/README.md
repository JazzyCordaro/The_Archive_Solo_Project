The Archive is a application that allows users to have a library of their movies
that they have at home. I made this so when I am shopping for new movies I can
search my app that I hosted on Heroku to ensure I don't buy the same movie twice.
The app allows the user to search for new movies using an API from OMDB. Your library
will be sorted in alphabetical order so it is easy to search while shopping. The
technologies I used are SQL, Bootstrap, jQuery, Express, and Node.js....
